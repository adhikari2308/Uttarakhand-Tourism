        The trek to Tungnath begins from Chopta, a small village known as the 'Mini Switzerland of India.' The hike, which is about 3.5 kilometers, is relatively easy and can be completed in a few hours, making it accessible for people of all ages. Once at the temple, visitors can enjoy the serene atmosphere and partake in various rituals and prayers. Tungnath is also known for its stunning landscapes, lush greenery, and a variety of flora and fauna, making it a paradise for photographers and adventure seekers.
