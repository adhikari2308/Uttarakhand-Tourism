        Kedarnath Temple, located in the Kedarnath town of Uttarakhand, India, is one of the holiest Hindu shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva. Nestled in the majestic Himalayas at an altitude of 3,583 meters (11,755 ft), it is part of the Char Dham pilgrimage and attracts thousands of devotees and tourists every year. The temple's architecture is stunning, featuring a pyramidal roof and a garbhagriha (sanctum) that houses the idol of Lord Kedarnath.

        The temple is open for devotees from April to November, as it is accessible only during these months due to heavy snowfall in the region. The journey to Kedarnath is an adventure in itself, often starting from Gaurikund, from where pilgrims trek approximately 16 kilometers uphill. The breathtaking views of the snow-capped peaks and the serene environment add to the spiritual experience of visiting this sacred site. The temple's significance is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology, and it is believed to be the place where Lord Shiva appeared in the form of a bull.
